## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Strengthen my understanding of **C programming fundamentals**
- Practice writing **clean and efficient code**
- Learn and apply **Git & GitHub version control**
- Build a **public portfolio** that showcases my growth as a developer
  

Each branch may represent a different topic, which gets merged into `main` once completed.
This way, the `main` branch always stays updated with clean, final versions of programs.
